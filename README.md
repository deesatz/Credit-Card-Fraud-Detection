# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Using various machine learning algorithms to identify fraudulent transactions on a highly imbalanced dataset

Key Highlights: 

1.Using various sampling techniques to deal with imbalance dataset: Undersample, oversample, smote algorithm 

2.Using various machine learning algorithm to train dataset after sampling: Logistics Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, Ensemble learning. 

3.Different sampling techniques do not yield significant result differences, hence not all combinations of sampling techniques+ML algorithms are shown 

4.Achieved AUC>0.96 (Random Forest), Recall score>92%
